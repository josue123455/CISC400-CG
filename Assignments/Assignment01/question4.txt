immediate mode- a mode in which graphics API library takes structure from API users. instructions to render each element
on the screen to be executed by the API user ever time the frame is rendered

Retained mode- the API user only needs to call the API to change the elements that needs to look different
so the API library holds a lost of elements to draw. this library has been passed in before

so which one is better immediate mode is its more lightweight and it can handle animations better than retained
 and should perform better

What are the three different types of light? Make sure to give an example of each

1st- is directional light this is best represented as natural light from the sun it's parallel and its very far away.
meaning that the light hits an object directly.

2nd- point light this type of light source emits light in all directions from one single point. the best way to represent
this is to think about a light bulb or a lamp, in your room.

3rd- Ambient light or indirect light emitted from other light source whether its directional or point. its light reflected
of of object and hits another object directly. You can think of this when light hits a mirror and bounces of the mirror to
hit another object.

Explain the difference between diffuse and ambient reflection.

Diffuse reflection- There is a light source hitting the object with light and the
reflection from the light are bouncing off the object equally.

Ambient reflection - Ambient reflection is the reflection of light from another light source,
the reflection leaving the object is the same as the reflected light coming onto the object.
